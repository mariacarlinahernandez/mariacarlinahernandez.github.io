# and Community Builder 🤝🌎

I'm a community leader (also an attendee), and of course a passionate speaker. Currently, I co-organize **IoT Medellin**, a community that seeks to promote general knowledge of  **"The Internet of Things"** in order to generate value in the industry with local talent in Colombia.
